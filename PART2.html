		<p>“Good morning sweet baby, common wake up you’re going to be late for school!” <br>

“Mom, I’m not a baby anymore and I hate school and mornings and everything just let me play videogames all day I promise I’ll make money” <br>

Yeah good vibes only *hihihihi* our baby rhino is doing great, growing up fast and straying away from God every day even faster. <br>

One thing is for sure: he no like rules nah-aH, he into hoodies and extremely large pants and his life is all about bitches and videogames- I would say heaven on earth but who am I to judge. <br>
“But damn, those make no money, they both spendin it. Hell nah I gotta do something about this man..”<br>

He smart tho, some hackin here, some hackin there and BOOM here comes the juice. Hold up, this ain’t right, this ain’t honest money, you gotta work bro no cheating. <br>

The mess wasn’t all in vain. On his desperate quest for money (to feed the bitches and play the games), Rhino found something even more helpful: he found Passion. He gladly guided him through tough times and made hard work look easy. Since then, Passion never left his sight.
