	<div class="content">
		<p>Rhino is now a grown up man, handsome  and hot - would totally smash any day - he got those cool tattoos that make the bitches go wild, plays guitar and, like it wasn’t enough, he’s a great actor. Yeah he cool, but he’s never alone, he got Passion as his best friend and they are totally killin it. <br>

Anyway, Passion has begun to lose his cool and started to talk all day about Freedom and how great she is, the way she smells, how beautiful she is and annoying stuff like that. Rhino got tired to hear Passion all day long complaining about Freedom not being with him so he decided to go look for her. They looked in every Starbucks in town but it seemed she s no ordinary bitch. She wasn’t easy to find, not even Snapchat map tracker couldn’t find her and she have no Instagram. Luckily, after a hardcore stalking session online, Rhino found one of Freedom’s old accounts on Goodreads. They quickly got in touch and finally met her at Booha. Apparently, she’s a huge celeb on Twitter under a fake name and she says the most outrageous stuff. <br>

Anyway, they totally hit it of from the start, Rhino and Passion couldn’t take their eyes off her. Tbh, this is all I know about their date,but they probably fucked or smh cause afterwards they were inseparable; all of them suddenly bloomed and improved exceptionally.</p>
