		<p>Passion and Freedom one day decided to finally netflix and chill in order to  achieve the greatest power ever *like omg*, and to congratulate them the Universe has presented both of them with a gift: a baby black rhino. <br>

Neither of them understood what the hell  was the baby for so they kicked him out from their land. The universe didn’t expect the rude attitude so he got really angry and made an ugly scene in front of all their friends. Like it wasn’t enough he decided to split the two mfs to teach  them a lesson. And so Passion and Freedom were left with no power, they couldn’t even text each other anymore *sad reacts only*...<br> 

 Now the universe who’s quite an emotional unstable bitch feels bad and makes them a deal: if the baby rhino can find each of them out there in the big ass world, they can be together again and make sex or whatever they do.<br>

So The baby was left wondering in a big and fucked up world with nothing except a little angel called Momma who loved the baby so much that she decided to take great care of it. </p>
