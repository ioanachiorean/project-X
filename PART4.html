		<p>Damn, life’s so good for Rhino rn: he’s travelling a lot thanks to Freedom, he’s also working with Passion on some awesome projects, makin some good money, and most importantly, his momma is healthy and proud of her baby. <br>

But the it's hard to keep a good work/life balance and Rhino is about to lose it- he wasn’t quite ready for all of this, everything happened too fast and he forgot he was only a rhino after all. Seeing their little rockstar starting to fall back, the golden couple came up with the most instagramable idea ever: BALI. <br>

Thanks to the “too perfect to be true” girls, meals, sun, sex and beaches, he found himself and started to understand life on a deeper level. He started to feel more grateful for the life he’s living, so he decided to go on a trip around the world to have non stop threesomes with Freedom and Passion. <br>

Everything sounded perfect, so they thought, but Universe had been secretly stalking all of them on Instagram and couldn’t take it anymore, not since Rhino’s got himself an expensive camera and started taking great shots on Instagram. It was horrible for Universe to see him THIS famous ..like stop it dude you’re too extra. And so the Universe paid a guy to steal Rhino’s camera while he was on the trip. What a dick move. The worst part, Universe didn’t even got the satisfaction to see Rhino upset. So that was it for Universe trying to sabotage Rhino from reaching success, She finally decided to let the dude have his way and enjoy life.<br>

Since then, Rhino’s been blooming, he’s been studying, he grows every day, cause now there's no psycho bitch (e.g. "Uni") stoping him from doing it.
